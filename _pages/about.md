Here is **Yiting Lin（林一挺）**.
I am currently a research assistant at BNU-HKBU United International College (Hong Kong Baptist University), advised by [A.P. Donglong CHEN](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/donglongchen/en), within Embedded System Lab for AI and Security. I am also a researcher in [Prof. Wenbin Cheng](https://jsjxy.zsc.edu.cn/szdw/szdwzg/1dje8dg8bfln5.shtml)'s postgraduate research team at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Zhongshan Institute. My research interests include Cryptography , Blockchain, Multimedia Security, Image Processingg, Nonlinear Systems and Applications, and AI Security.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - YitingLin [at] ieee.org

## Research Interests

- Cryptography
- Blockchain
- Information Security
- Artificial Intelligence (ML/DL)

My current research focuses on the practical problems faced by the intersection of cryptography and other disciplines in real-life applications. My interests are blockchain and fully homomorphic encryption and their applications in industrial IoT and life. My research also involves some areas of artificial intelligence. In short, advanced technologies such as cryptography, artificial intelligence, and the Internet have a positive impact on everyone's life. I hope to devote my talents to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.
