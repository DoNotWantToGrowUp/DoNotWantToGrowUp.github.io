With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies, multimedia information has become an essential part of communication. As a carrier with high information density and large transmission volume, image data is increasingly at risk of information leakage. To address the issue of digital private image leakage, this paper proposes a reliable image security protection scheme based on a non-degenerate hyperchaotic system for dynamic permutation and single-round composite diffusion. By leveraging the high dynamic properties of non-degenerate chaos, the scheme effectively addresses the insufficient sensitivity of pseudo-random sequences to initial values and enhances the sensitivity of the key to initial conditions. Additionally, the single-round composite double-diffusion system significantly improves the security and reliability of the algorithm, with the information entropy of the encrypted image reaching 7.9994. Experimental and theoretical verification demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits high sensitivity and effective robustness, capable of resisting common attacks and providing a reliable security solution for communication and the IoT.
