The protection of digital image privacy in Big Data environment is a hot issue of increasing concern. To address the contradiction between efficiency and security for privacy protection, this paper proposes a high-quality restored image privacy protection scheme based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) frequency domain compression and nonlinear dynamics. First, the RGB space of the color image is converted to YCbCr domain with 4:2:0 sampling. Then, the image is divided into sub-blocks in the spatial domain, followed by block-wise DCT and quantization into frequency domain information. Next, both Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) coefficients of all sub-blocks are individually extracted and subjected to compression encoding. Finally, a Rubik’s Cube permutation and filtering diffusion encryption algorithm based on a nonlinear dynamical chaotic system is designed. Moreover, a mechanism for generating dynamic chaotic sequences associated with plaintext is introduced to effectively counter cryptographic attacks. The combined approach of compression and encryption significantly reduces computational complexity while improving encryption efficiency. Through experimental simulation results, the compression encryption scheme demonstrates high compression ratios as well as excellent image recovery quality while providing enhanced security against common cryptographic attacks. The work in this paper provides a preferred joint compression and encryption technical solution for digital image privacy protection in Big Data network.
