This article proposes a secure communication enhancement scheme based on face detection and chaotic partition permutation. The scheme uses edge detection technology to detect facial information, which is then used as an encryption object. The hash value of the plaintext image is extracted as the secret key to the chaotic sequence generated by the chaotic system. Then a series of encryption operations are performed on the face image to obtain the final ciphertext image. In this article, two chaotic systems are used to generate pseudo-random chaotic sequences for different encryption steps. The initial key is computed by combining the hash function of the image and external parameters. The experimental results and security analysis show that the algorithm has excellent encryption effectiveness and security performance against various typical attacks.
