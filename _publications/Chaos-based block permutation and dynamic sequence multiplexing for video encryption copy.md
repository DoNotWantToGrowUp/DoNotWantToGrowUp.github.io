In the digital age, the proliferation of social media platforms has significantly increased public awareness of privacy security. The potential leakage of image privacy poses a grave threat as it can expose sensitive information and cause severe crises. To address this critical issue, this paper introduces an advanced privacy protection scheme that integrates chaos-driven Fractal Sorting Matrix (FSM) and Fibonacci Q-Matrix (FQM) techniques. The proposed scheme, known as the privacy image secrecy scheme based on chaos-driven FSM and FQM (PICFF), utilizes a 2D-LSM chaotic system to generate secure pseudo-random sequences for encryption. The FSM permutation technique, driven by chaos, effectively alters the positional information of the image, enhancing security through iterative and self-similar transformations. Additionally, the FQM encryption matrix, which traditionally employs static encryption, is dynamically enhanced by incorporating a chaotic system, ensuring strong correlation with the plaintext and further bolstering encryption reliability. Experimental validation demonstrates that the PICFF scheme excels in terms of information entropy and robustness. The encrypted images exhibit a uniform pixel distribution, reduced pixel correlation, and high information entropy, closely aligning with theoretical values. The scheme also showcases exceptional resistance to various attacks, including cropping attacks and salt-and-pepper noise, effectively preventing privacy information leakage and providing robust support for maintaining information security and enhancing privacy protection.
