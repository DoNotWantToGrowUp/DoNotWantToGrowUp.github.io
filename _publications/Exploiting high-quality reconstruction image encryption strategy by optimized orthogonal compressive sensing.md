Compressive sensing is favored because it breaks through the constraints of Nyquist sampling law in signal reconstruction. However, the security defects of joint compression encryption and the problem of low quality of reconstructed image restoration need to be solved urgently. In view of this, this paper proposes a compressive sensing image encryption scheme based on optimized orthogonal measurement matrix. Utilizing a combination of DWT and OMP, along with chaos, the proposed scheme achieves high-security image encryption and superior quality in decryption reconstruction. Firstly, the orthogonal optimization method is used to improve the chaotic measurement matrix. Combined with Part Hadamard matrix, the measurement matrix with strong orthogonal characteristics is constructed by Kronecker product. Secondly, the original image is sparsely represented by DWT. Meanwhile, Arnold scrambling is used to disturb the correlation between its adjacent pixels. Following this, the image is compressed and measured in accordance with the principles of compressive sensing and obtain the intermediate image to be encrypted. Finally, the chaotic sequence generated based on 2D-LSCM is used to perform on odd-even interleaved diffusion and row-column permutation at bit-level to obtain the final ciphertext. The experimental results show that this scheme meets the cryptographic requirements of obfuscation, diffusion and avalanche effects, and also has a large key space, which is sufficient to resist brute-force cracking attacks. Based on the sparse and reconstruction algorithm of compressive sensing proposed in this paper, it has better image restoration quality than similar algorithms. Consequently, the compressive sensing image encryption scheme enhances both security and reconstruction quality, presenting promising applications in the evolving landscape of privacy protection for network big data.
