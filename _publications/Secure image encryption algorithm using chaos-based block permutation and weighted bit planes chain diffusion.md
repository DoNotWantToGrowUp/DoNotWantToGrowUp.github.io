Aiming at the problem of insufficient security of image encryption technology, a secure image encryption algorithm using chaos-based block permutation and weighted bit planes chain diffusion is proposed, which is based on a variant structure of classical permutation-diffusion. During the permutation phase, the encryption operations of dividing an image into sub-block, block scrambling, block rotation and block inversion, negative-positive transformation, color component shuffling are performed sequentially with chaotic sequences of plaintext association. In the chain diffusion stage, different encryption strategies are adopted for the high and low 4-bit planes according to the weight of image information. Theoretical analyses and empirical results substantiate that the algorithm conforms to the cryptographic requirements of confusion, diffusion, and avalanche effects, while possessing excellent numerical statistical properties with a large cryptographic space. Therefore, the cryptanalysis-propelled security enhancement mechanism proposed in this paper effectively amplifies the aptitude of the algorithm to withstand cryptographic attacks.
